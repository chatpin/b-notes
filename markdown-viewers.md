## note 

> I made a decission, a short while ago, that I would learn how to employ Vim productively. I use it exclusively for writing and editing documents, config files and for python coding. I therefore naturally began using it for note-taking purposes. I do However ocasionally like to view a markdown document before it's uploaded, to github for example, to check it's all rendered and formated how I expect. For that purpose I began making use of a program called ReText, which along with the [fakevim](https://github.com/retext-project/retext/wiki/FakeVim-mode) library plugin, enables users to employ Vim like keyboard commands in normal, input and visual modes. It's a simple, easy to use and effective program. On starting up an instance of Retext you are presented with a dual pane interface. Your plain text document is located in the lefthand pane, where you can apply simple edits, while in the right hand pane you can view a live updated preview.
