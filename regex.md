## notes

>Linux Regular Expressions are special characters which help search data and matching complex patterns. Regular expressions are shortened as 'regexp' or 'regex'. They are used in many Linux programs like grep, bash, rename, sed, etc.





> "regex, [grep](/home/pi/Documents/notesystem/grep.md), [sed](/home/pi/Documents/notesystem/sed-index.md), etc are a set of tools which can, for example be employed to search through or for files and folders. However, their value can best be seen when they are applied in conjunction with specific commands."
