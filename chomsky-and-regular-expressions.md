note
## Chomsky: what does he have to do with regular expressions?

a link to an article which sites [Noam Chomsky](https://www.linux.com/news/exploring-linguistics-behind-regular-expressions/) as having a profound impact and "transforming the code that computer scientists, software engineers, and hobbyists write today." 

##### footnote

coincidental that a Carol Chomsky was one of the developers mentioned in the [hypertext documentary](https://archive.org/details/AndyVanDamHypertextFilm)?
