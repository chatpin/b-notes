# reflecting-back/notes-taking
note
## beginings

So where to begin? Probably with my initial motivation

It began about a year ago, coinciding with the decision to try to repurpose the old (2005) ppc-mac-mini with an install of FreeBSD. I found taking down notes, usually on scraps of paper, indispensible. I would copy down instructions, lists of simple commands and then anything else I thought might be useful. My notes-taking process at that stage might better be described as 'collecting'. Those initial notes were then eventually sorted and transfered to a (handwritten) notebook. This in turn lead me to explore the subject: practice and methodologies employed in note-taking systems.

More recently I have begun the process of transcribing the contents of the notebook into an online digital archive, where it can be made freely available at all times. My aims in undertaking this project are:
 

 * To use it as the means to further investigate the subject of note-taking systems and methodologies.



 * To explore a range of tools to gain a better understanding of their potential. 



 *  To eventually develop a suitable personal system to support my projects, ideas and encourage organised and interconnected thinking.
