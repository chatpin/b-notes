**Roberto Busa and James joyce linked by Thomas Aquinas**

In November 1904 James Joyce made some notebook entries about aesthetics. These notes were speculations about Thomas Aquinasâ€™ ideas of the true, the good and the beautiful, and Joyce later incorporated them in his novel 'A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'.

Roberto Busa, an Italian Jesuit priest was one of the pioneers in the usage of computers for linguistic and literary analysis. 

In 1980 he published the Index Thomisticus, as a tool for performing text searches within the massive corpus of Aquinas's works. The project lasted about 30 years (1949-1980), and was the first important hypertext work about the Saints books.
