## search in files 
- If you want to search in files you can use an external program (traditionally grep) for searching. Do it within Vim using :grep, so that you have the output available in Vim to view and navigate by.

- Depending on your system, you may find that a command like the following will quickly search files: 

```
:grep pattern *.c
```
___  
[index](./index-file.md)
[home](./home.md)
