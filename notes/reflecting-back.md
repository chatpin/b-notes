# Reflecting Back: Note-Taking
Where to begin? Probably with my initial motivation.

In 2019, I set out to repurpose an old (2005) PPC Mac Mini by installing FreeBSD. As I worked through the process, I found that jotting down notes—often on scraps of paper—became indispensable. I recorded instructions, simple command lists, and anything else that seemed useful. At that stage, my note-taking was more akin to *collecting* rather than organizing. Eventually, I sorted and transferred these notes into a handwritten notebook, which led me to explore note-taking as a structured practice—its methodologies, tools, and potential applications.

More recently, I’ve begun transcribing the contents of my notebook into a digital archive, making it freely accessible at all times. My goals for this project are:

- To deepen my understanding of note-taking systems and methodologies.
- To explore various tools and assess their potential.
- To develop a personal system that supports my projects, ideas, and fosters organized, interconnected thinking.
