> **Roberto Busa, James joyce and Thomas Aquinas**



> [Roberto Busa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Busa), an Italian Jesuit priest was one of the pioneers in the usage of computers for linguistic and literary analysis. 

> In 1980 he published the Index Thomisticus, as a tool for performing text searches within the massive corpus of Aquinas's works. The project lasted about 30 years (1949-1980), and was the first important [hypertext](/home/pi/Documents/hypertext.md) work about Saint [Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas) books.

> [James Joyce](https://jamesjoyce.ie/on-this-day-7-november/) made some notebook entries about aesthetics in November 1904. These [notes](https://jamesjoyce.ie/on-this-day-7-november/) were speculations about [Thomas Aquinas](http://www.jjon.org/joyce-s-allusions/aquinas)â€™ ideas of the true, the good and the beautiful, and Joyce later incorporated them in his novel 'A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'.
