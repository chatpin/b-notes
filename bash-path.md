## notes


> add directories to your path with the following command, where directory is the name of the directory you want to add:

> export PATH=$PATH:directory

> a better way would be to edit your .bash_profile or .profile file (depending on your distribution) to include the above command. That way, it would be done automatically every time you log in.

[home](./home.md)
