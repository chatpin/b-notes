## note

> #### Adding directories to your path 

> add directories to your path with the following command, where directory is the name of the directory you want to add:

> export PATH=$PATH:directory

> a better way would be to edit your .bash_profile or .profile file (depending on your distribution) to include the above command. That way, it would be done automatically every time you log in.

> [index](./index-file.md)
> [bash-scripting-cheat](./bash-scripting-cheat.md)

> [bash-academy](./bash-academy.md)

> [home](./home.md)
