Add directories to your path with the following command, where directory is the name of the directory you want to add:

export PATH=$PATH:directory

Edit your .bash_profile or .profile file (depending on your distribution) to include the above command. That way, it would be done automatically every time you log in.

[index](./index-file.md)
[bash-scripting-cheat](./bash-scripting-cheat.md)
