# sin
<u>simple indexed notes</u>
___


> **sin** is series of notes, each consisting of either some basic command, script snippet or a useful link. Each note is in an easily readable format, using simple markdown, and explores some aspect of: bash, vim or note-taking itself. This is a living document at this point and should not be considered anything other than a very basic initial draft.

> **sin** is what might be described as part of a recursive project, utilising mostly baseline tools, it is a work in progress. The ultimate goal is for sin to provide me with a set of tools, whilst being a simple resource that's made freely available. 

___
## Setup

> editor: Vim

> shell: Bash

> VCS: Git
