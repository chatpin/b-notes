#Zettelkasten / Thinking and Writing
##Developing a Personal Tool for Thinking and Writing

###Context
I first came across the Zettelkasten method while considering how to digitize my handwritten notebooks. What immediately stood out was the vibrant discussion around thinking and writing, as well as the numerous shared workflows and solutions from users.

###Aims
To develop a cross-referencing, bidirectional linking, knowledge management, and note-taking system.

###Requirements

+ A personal tool for thinking and writing.
+ An interconnected web of notes to facilitate idea development.
+ A simple and intuitive way to navigate between notes.
+ An efficient search function for retrieving content.
+ Accessibility at all times, whether over a local network or via a server.
