## developing a personal tool for thinking and writing
___

## context

I stumbled upon the '[Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/)' for the first time whilst exploring ways to transcribe the contents of a (handwritten) notebook into a digital asset. I was immediately struck by the online community around the zettelkasten. There appeared to be a very active ongoing discussion about thinking and writing. Plus many instances of users sharing examples (and solutions) with regards to their work-flow.

## aims
 
To developa a cross referencing, bidirectional linking, knowledge managment and note-taking system. 

## requirements
A personal tool for thinking and writing.

Create an interconnected web of notes (thought).

A simple method for finding and navigating between notes.
  
A simple method for searching the contents of notes.
  
They should be accessible at all times over a local network or via a server.
