### less-than and greater-than symbols
> (I chanced upon this tip somewhere but can't remember where)

> The less-than and greater-than symbols cannot be used by themselves in Markdown without escaping each by putting a `\` character immediately before them. Using `<` instead of `\<` and `>` instead of `\>` might cause the Markdown document to not render properly.

> The less-than and greater-than symbols should look like \<\> this in text when you use `\<\>`.

> The less-than and greater-than symbols should look like `<>` this in text when you surround them with backticks <code>`</code> like this:

> ```
> `<>`
> ```

> The less-than and greater-than symbols should look like this (below) when they are in a full code block.

> ```
> <>
> ```

> Make sure you surround your code blocks with a blank line above and below them to make sure they render properly.
