## less-than and greater-than symbols

I chanced upon this tip [here](https://gist.github.com/garrettheath4/8fd6807f8d7eb2e26e3595993f35fd27#file-symbols-md)

Use `\<` instead of `<` and `\>` instead of `>` causes the Markdown document to render properly.


The less-than and greater-than symbols should look like `<>` this in text when you surround them with backticks <code>`</codelike this:

```
`<>`
```

The less-than and greater-than symbols should look like this (below) when they are in a full code block.

```
<>
```

code blocks require a blank line above and below them to render properly.
