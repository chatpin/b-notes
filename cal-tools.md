## note

> The calendar file is preprocessed by the system's C preprocessor, allowing the inclusion of shared files such as holidays or meetings. I have a [calendar.fixtures](~/.calendar/calendar.fixtures) file containing the football fixtures for the season,

> If the shared file is not referenced by a full pathname, the preprocessor searches in the current (or home) directory first, and then in the directory /etc/calendar, and finally in /usr/share/calendar. Empty lines and lines protected by the C commenting syntax (/* ... */) are ignored.
