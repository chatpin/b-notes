#hypertext and Ted Nelson 

Ted Nelson appeared in a [Werner Herzog] documentry called [Lo and Behold: Reveries of the Connected World](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5275828/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_8) (2016). His analogy of information as being like water moving past and over his hand was intriguing. He is cited as one of the pioneers of (and credited as the person who coined the expression) [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) back in the early 1960's.

###Types and uses of hypertext



> Hypertext documents can either be static (prepared and stored in advance) or dynamic (continually changing in response to user input, such as dynamic web pages). Static hypertext can be used to cross-reference collections of data in documents, software applications, or books on CDs. A well-constructed system can also incorporate other user-interface conventions, such as menus and command lines. Links used in a hypertext document usually replace the current piece of hypertext with the destination document. A lesser known feature is StretchText, which expands or contracts the content in place, thereby giving more control to the reader in determining the level of detail of the displayed document. Some implementations support transclusion, where text or other content is included by reference and automatically rendered in place.



> Hypertext can be used to support very complex and dynamic systems of linking and cross-referencing. The most famous implementation of hypertext is the World Wide Web, written in the final months of 1990 and released on the Internet in 1991.
