## notes

> Invoking netrw, vim's built in finder, can be achieved in three ways

>> :Explore - opens netrw in the current window

>> :Sexplore - opens netrw in a horizontal split

>> :Vexplore - opens netrw in a vertical split

> There are four different view types: thin, long, wide and tree.
With the directory browser open hit i to cycle through the view types.
A preferred view type can be made permanent by setting it in a .vimrc file.
