____




> [sed](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Core_utilities#Essentials) was based on the scripting features of the interactive editor [ed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(text_editor)) ("editor", 1971) and the earlier qed ("quick editor", 1965â€“66). sed was one of the earliest tools to support regular expressions, and remains in use for text processing, most notably with the substitution command. Popular alternative tools for plaintext string manipulation and "stream editing" include [AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK) and [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl).
