**notes/**

  * stumbled upon the 'fakevim plugin' , this morning. This  has extended retexts useability no end.  
  * I need to look into the possibilty of further enhancing and [configuring](https://github.com/hluk/FakeVim/blob/master/README.md#example-vimrc) it to work like vim.
  * opening a new note automatically includes date/time stamped, etc.
