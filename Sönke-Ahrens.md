"enable thinking outside of the brain"

"enables you to challenge yourself outside of your brain"

"software can make a difference"¹ 

¹ *I think this relates to its ability to support and enhance your practice, primarily by being invisible and not something you have to think about whilst note -keeping and retrieval*
