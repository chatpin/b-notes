#zettelkasten


**context**
> I stumbled upon '[Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/)' whilst exploring ways to turn my (physical) notebook into a digital asset, available at all times over a local network or via a server online. 



> The thing that intrigued me was that this system offered a cross referencing, bidirectional linking method - rather than creating some form of recursive folder hierarchy. 


**aims**



> It also fits in with an interest in learning more basic bash and vim scripting to look at ways to interact with the pc to automate repetitive processes and speed up admin tasks.
