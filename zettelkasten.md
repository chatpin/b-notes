## notes

> #### <u>context</u>

> I stumbled upon the '[Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/)' for the first time whilst exploring ways to turn a (physical) notebook into a digital asset.

> The thing that intrigued me was that the community around this system.

> They offered many examples and solutions, such as hot go about implimenting a cross referencing, bidirectional linking method. 

> This seemed preferable to creating some form of recursive folder hierarchy. 


> #### <u>Motivation</u>   

  > Method for finding notes
  
  > Navigating between files
  
  > Search contents of notes
  
  > It should also be available at all times over a local network (or via a server online).
