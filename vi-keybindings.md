| Ctrl-c               | escapes insert mode  | 
| ctrl-[               | also Esc insert mode | 
| Alt+j                | all take yo u to     |
| Alt+h                | normal mode and move |
| Alt+k                | in the expected direction | 
| Alt+l                | (basically Esc insert mode) | 
| f-(character to find) | find character after cursor in current line |
